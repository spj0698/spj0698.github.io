								<p>Yup, that handsome fellow right there is me. Hello stranger! My name is Sagar Joshi and I'm a graduate from
                                California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) with my Bachelor's in Computer Science. My goal in life is to be a part of a
								team that constructs beneficial, efficient, and convienent software for consumers. I want to continue
								innovating and improving software that could benefit others by assisting them with certain tasks and 
								making the process easier for them. Currently, I work at Ingram Micro as their IT Associate where I take part
                                of a rotational program where I work under multiple departments: Project Manangement Office (PMO), Information Technology,
                                Infrastructure, and Product Engineering. During my time at CSUF, I served as the Technical Lead for the Developer Student 
								Club (DSC), worked as a Supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader for the Mathematics department, and served as the Engineering 
                                Ambassador for CSUF's Engineering and Computer Science campus. Outside of campus and coding, I love taking part of basketball 
                                adult recreational leagues, listen to music, attend concerts/music festivals, and play with my dog Champ. If you would like to 
                                learn more about me, you can find the links to my social media under the <a href="#contact">Contacts</a> tab.
